# Fellowship One API

## Interacting with Fellowship One

This package only provides 2nd Party authentication and the ability to make GET, POST, and PUT requests.  You must build your own package/controllers to actually interact with Fellowship One data.

Before starting, you need to have a "Portal User" account that is linked to a specific user in your Fellowship One database.  You also must have a 2nd Party Application enabled in your church's Fellowship One admin section.

## Installation

### Service Provider

Add the following to your service provider array

    Avr\F1\F1ServiceProvider

### Configuration

Copy the configuration file

    php artisan config:publish avr/f1

Set the appropriate credentials and base URLs.

## Usage

In any class, add `use F1;` before the class declaration.

The builtin `F1` faÃ§ade uses Guzzle's HTTP Client + OauthPlugin to make the requests.  Consult their documentation for building requests and handling responses.

For example, create a request to Fellowship One's API by using the appropriate endpoint and format:

    $request = F1::get('v1/people/statuses.json')->send();

Using Guzzle, there are multiple ways to handle the response:

    $response = $request->getBody(true);

Or, use Guzzle's built in `json()` method:

    $response = $request->json();

Check Guzzle's documentation for more help (including leveraging Exceptions, etc).
